# Instructions  

In this assignment, you'll be simulating generations of breeding of double-heterozygote pea plants.

We've written the basic simulation for you, but all the calculations are missing!

## Required Task 
Your job is to implement the following functions:

1. `choose_feature(pheno1, pheno2)`
2. `cross(c1, c2)`
3. `is_green(creature)`
4. `is_wrinkled(creature)`
5. `percentage_green(population)`
6. `percentage_wrinkled(population)`
7. `percentage_green(population)`
8. `percentage_green_and_wrinkled(population)`
9. `generation(population)`

We have provided explanations of what these functions are supposed to do as docstrings inside the functions themselves in `main.py`.


## Creative Tasks 
Make at least **three** enhancements to the plotting of your choice.
